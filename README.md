Example of Volatility-Based Decomposition in a single project format 

The goal of this version is to show how VBD concepts can be applied to a single library project.  There are seperate projects for the UX components and the tests.  

The resource is technically outside the scope of VBD.  My intent is to use this same database for these examples. 

VBD concpets can be applied to any size project.  Organizing your code to follow the VBD model allows for easier upleveling.
